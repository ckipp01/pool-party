# Pool Party! (code coverage demo)

This is an example of how code coverage can be applied to a Scala 3 project
using [tpolecat/pool-party](https://github.com/tpolecat/pool-party).


You can test this by publishing [this dotty
branch](https://github.com/ckipp01/dotty/tree/coverage) and then running `sbt
testCoverage`.
